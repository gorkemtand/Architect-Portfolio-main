        image1Desc: "The residential area on the northeast side of the island aligns with the prevailing westward trade winds. Under the influence of these dominant winds, the transition from a clear and calm sky to a cloudy, windy, and rainy weather occurs within minutes, a phenomenon commonly experienced in Hawaii's climate. Therefore, the design is shaped accordingly in response to these conditions.",

        image2Desc: "The triangular courtyard at the center of the residence is utilized as an outdoor space, serving as a roofless, true extension of the interior. This sheltered outdoor space can be comfortably used regardless of whether the weather is windy, foggy, or sunny. The courtyard's floor is covered with the frequently encountered Pahoehoe lava slabs in the region. Access to the courtyard is provided from the kitchen and living areas, and it is surrounded by glass surfaces on three sides.",

        image3Desc: "The property owners prioritize transparency over privacy. This preference directly influences the floor plan design, as Craig Steely Architecture develops a plan with open doors and no solid boundaries. Thanks to its extensive glass facades, the interior of the residence embraces Hawaii's typical landscapes, maintaining uninterrupted visual contact. Each of the three sides of the residence features small verandas that enhance interaction with nature.",

        image1Desc: "A small gap forms the entrance. From the street, three exposed shapes of concrete blend strikingly and puristically, leaving no room for a glimpse inside. The ground floor is completely closed to the street, it dissolves to the forest by large glass elements, which flood the space with light, and produces an intense connection to the environment and nature. The upper floor forms a creative contrast to the ground floor.",
        image2Url: "https://storage.googleapis.com/gorkemtandogan-images/Projects/Architect%20Portfolio/2_image2.jpg",
        image2Desc: "This villa breaks with all traditions and forms an unrestrained contrast to the otherwise natural surroundings. Like an artistic installation on a podium made of natural stone, which at the same time forms the underground car park, lies the two-story villa and clearly focuses on the forest as the main point of reference. The shape of the building is based on the idea of an L, which borders the hillside of the plot while providing a sheltered outdoor-space for the terrace.",
        image3Url: "https://storage.googleapis.com/gorkemtandogan-images/Projects/Architect%20Portfolio/2_image3.jpg",
        image3Desc: "This modern villa features a striking design with glass and steel elements set against a protective concrete structure. The bedrooms offer intimate forest views through expansive floor-to-ceiling windows. Steel slats intricately connect the house's levels, fostering a unique living experience that harmonizes sculpture and minimalism. This innovative design reimagines traditional concepts, ensuring residents a distinctive connection with nature.",

        image1Desc: "The pool was originally designed as an all-concrete structure and was adjusted to incorporate the acrylic wall after construction had begun. A wide range of trades were involved in the construction of the pool. The acrylic wall required waterproofing to be discreetly integrated with the structural panels and columns to provide a soft visual effect. This required a high degree of coordination and negotiation, as the tolerances were very tight.",

        image2Desc: "Conceptually, the spatial planning of the house separates social and family spaces. Downstairs, the interconnected kitchen, living room, dining room and outdoor spaces create a highly interactive and engaging site designed to accommodate large groups. A unique above-ground pool that shares a transparent wall with the social spaces acts as a visual connection between the indoor and outdoor spaces, refracting natural light throughout the home.",
        image3Url: "https://storage.googleapis.com/gorkemtandogan-images/Projects/Architect%20Portfolio/3_image3.jpg",
        image3Desc: "Craftsmanship shines through the material palette, featuring Kobe planks, polished concrete, wood, and steel columns that highlight the structural systems. The visible wood and steel structure, inside and out, required meticulous attention to detail during siding and window installations. This dedication to showcasing the construction process adds a unique layer of character to the home.",
